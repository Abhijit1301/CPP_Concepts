Ans: No. compile time error.

5. How to modify a member variable inside a const member function?

Ans: 1. the "mutable" keyword
	 2. use a pointer to the member variable.

Ans: yes

7. Is the "this" pointer an rvalue or an lvalue?

Ans: rvalue

8. How to use a class type inside a class, i.e. as a member type? (not as a pointer or reference type)
